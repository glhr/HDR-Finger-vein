# Implementation of HDR for image acquisition on a finger vein scanner

Bachelor Thesis: [Implementation of HDR for image acquisition on a finger vein scanner. (2018)](https://essay.utwente.nl/75640/)

**Abstract** — A novel approach to finger vein image acquisition
consists of capturing a multi-intensity sequence of images and
merging them into a single HDR image to record a maximum
amount of vein detail.
Two HDR methods are proposed and evaluated: basic scalar
weighting which maximizes entropy, and weighting with a moving
mean filter which increases local contrast and background homogeneity.
Both methods show promising vein recognition results:
a higher level of vein detail was detected using both Maximum
Curvature and Repeated Line Tracking than with a single LDR
finger vein image. A small-scale vein matching experiment with
3 samples of 4 different fingers from the same person gave no
false positives or negatives, and showed improvement compared
to using single LDR image. Further testing with large datasets is
required in order to draw broader conclusions about recognition
performance.
